    "Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-Use a specific exception class whenever possible: Catching a specific exception \n",
    "class instead of a more general one makes your code more readable and helps to ensure \n",
    "that you're handling the correct type of error. For example, if you're trying to open a\n",
    "file, catch FileNotFoundError instead of Exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Avoid catching Exception and BaseException: Catching these broad exception classes \n",
    "can make it harder to debug your code and may cause unexpected errors. \n",
    "It's better to catch only the exceptions that you expect to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-Use try/except blocks sparingly: Try to keep your try/except blocks as small as possible.\n",
    "If you catch too many exceptions in a single block, it can make it harder to debug your code \n",
    "and can also hide errors that you weren't expecting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-Use the finally block for cleanup: If you need to perform cleanup operations,\n",
    "such as closing a file or database connection, use the finally block. This block is\n",
    "executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "5-Use logging to handle exceptions: Instead of printing error messages to the console, \n",
    "use Python's built-in logging module to log error messages. This makes it easier to debug \n",
    "your code and allows you to control the level of detail that is logged.\n",
    "\n",
    "6-Reraise exceptions if appropriate: If you catch an exception but are unable to handle it, \n",
    "it's a good practice to reraise the exception so that it can be handled further up the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "7-Use context managers: Context managers can simplify your code and make it more readable. \n",
    "They can also help ensure that resources are properly cleaned up, even if an exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "8-Handle exceptions at the right level: Exceptions should be handled at the level where\n",
    "they can be most effectively dealt with. For example, if an exception occurs in a function\n",
    "that's part of a larger system, handle the exception at the system level rather than at the function level.\n",
